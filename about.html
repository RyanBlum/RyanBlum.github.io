                My name is Ryan Blum, and I am a software engineer and web developer.   <br><br>
                In May 2019, I earned my BSc in Biology from the University of Florida. 
                There I got the chance to gain insight into the world of clinical research and biochemistry. 
                It was during this time that I discovered my passion of coding, and I knew that this is where I wanted to take my career. 
                Since then I have been diving into a myriad of projects, from games to web scapers and dynamic web pages. <br><br>
                My goal is to create meaningful tech solutions to help solve the worlds problems!
